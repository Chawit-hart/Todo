# Requirements

The Todo App must meet the following requirements:

1. **Login Page**: A page where users can enter their username and password.
2. **JWT Authentication**: Upon successful login, the app generates a JWT token and stores it in the user's browser cookies.
3. **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users (with a valid token) can access the Todo list and perform actions.
4. **Todo Management**: Users should be able to add and delete their todos. Each user sees only their own todos.
5. **Frontend**: Developed using **Next.js** (with TypeScript) and **React**.
6. **Backend**: REST API for handling user authentication and todo management.
