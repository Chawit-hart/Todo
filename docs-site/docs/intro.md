# Introduction

This project is a **Todo App** developed using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. The app features a **login page**, **protected routes**, and allows users to **add** and **delete** tasks (todos). Authentication is handled via **JWT tokens** stored in **cookies**, ensuring that users only see their own todos.

In this documentation, we will cover the requirements, architecture, authentication flow, and API reference of the application.
